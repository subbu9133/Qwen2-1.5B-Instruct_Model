# Binary Sentiment Analysis Model — End-to-End Documentation

## 1. Model Overview

- **Model Name:** Qwen2-Binary-Sentiment (custom fine-tuned)
- **Base Model:** Qwen2 (Qwen2-1.5B or Qwen2-4B)
- **Fine-tuning Method:** LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, PEFT
- **Task:** Binary Sentiment Classification (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE)
- **Use Cases:** Product reviews, customer feedback, social media analysis, support tickets, social media posts

## 2. Data & Test Cases

- **Training Datasets:**
  - Amazon Reviews (product review dataset)
  - Twitter Sentiment140 (tweets labeled as positive/negative)
  - Synthetic/custom annotated data (for edge cases and balancing)
- **Test Cases:** 104 (see `test_cases_20250826_032309.txt`)
- **Test Data:**
  - Balanced mix of positive and negative examples
  - Covers product, service, experience, and general sentiment
- **Examples:**
  - Positive: "I absolutely love this product! It exceeded all my expectations and works perfectly."
  - Negative: "This product is terrible, it broke after just one day of use."

## 3. Inference & Analysis

- **Main Script:** `sentiment_analysis_complete_testing (1).py`
- **Inference Pipeline:**
  1. Loads model weights and tokenizer
  2. Reads test cases from file
  3. For each input, generates prediction and confidence
  4. Aggregates results and explanations
- **Analysis Method:** Binary positive/negative classification (forced decision, no neutral)
- **Prompt Engineering:** Multiple prompts used for ensemble prediction (see `prompt_results` column)
- **Logging:** All predictions, confidences, and explanations are logged for traceability

## 4. Results

- **Results File:** `sentiment_analysis_results_20250826_032309.csv`
- **Columns:**
  - `text`: Input text
  - `predicted_sentiment`: Model prediction (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE)
  - `confidence`: Model confidence (0.85–0.95 typical)
  - `raw_response`: Model's raw output
  - `generated_part`: Model's generated explanation for the prediction
  - `prompt_results`: List of results from different prompt templates (ensemble)
  - `analysis_method`: Classification method used (binary forced)
  - `expected_sentiment`: Ground truth label
  - `is_correct`: Whether prediction matches ground truth
  - `test_case_id`: (if present) Reference to the test case number
- **Result Storage:**
  - Results are saved in CSV for easy analysis
  - Additional reports in DOCX and PDF for sharing

### Example Results

| Text | Predicted | Confidence | Expected | Correct |
|------|-----------|------------|----------|---------|
| I absolutely love this product! | POSITIVE | 0.95 | POSITIVE | True |
| This product is terrible, it broke after just one day of use. | NEGATIVE | 0.94 | NEGATIVE | True |

- **Detailed Explanations:** Each prediction includes a generated explanation for transparency
- **Ensemble Prompts:** Multiple prompt results are aggregated for robustness
- **Accuracy:** Nearly all cases are correctly classified.
- **Confidence:** Most predictions are above 0.90.
- **Error Analysis:** No major misclassifications observed in the provided results.

## 5. Model Strengths

- High accuracy for binary sentiment (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE)
- Consistent confidence scores (0.85–0.95)
- Ensemble/multi-prompt support for robust predictions
- Fast inference (suitable for production)
- Detailed explanations for each prediction
- Traceable results with ground truth comparison
- Easy integration with other ML pipelines

## 6. Usage

- **Input:** Any text string (from reviews, feedback, social media, etc.)
- **Output:**
  - Sentiment label (POSITIVE/NEGATIVE)
  - Confidence score
  - Generated explanation
  - Prompt-level ensemble results
- **Batch Processing:** Supported via script for large datasets
- **Integration:** Can be wrapped as an API or used in notebooks

## 7. Files in `Binary results` Folder

- `sentiment_analysis_complete_testing (1).py`: Main testing script (contains model loading, inference, logging)
- `sentiment_analysis_results_20250826_032309.csv`: Full results with all details
- `test_cases_20250826_032309.txt`: List of all test cases (used for evaluation)
- `Qwen2_Binary_Sentiment_Analysis_Results_20250826_032309.docx`: Documented results (for sharing)
- `Code and results.pdf`: PDF report (for external review)
- Additional logs and intermediate files (if any)

## 8. How to Run

1. Prepare your test cases in a text file (see `test_cases_20250826_032309.txt`).
2. Run the testing script (`sentiment_analysis_complete_testing (1).py`) to generate predictions.
3. Review the CSV for detailed results and accuracy.
4. Check DOCX/PDF for summary reports.
5. For retraining, update training data and rerun fine-tuning pipeline.

## 9. Minor Details & Best Practices

- **Model Versioning:** Always note the model version and training date in reports
- **Data Preprocessing:** Texts are cleaned, normalized, and tokenized before inference
- **Prompt Engineering:** Multiple prompt templates used for robustness
- **Logging:** All steps and predictions are logged for reproducibility
- **Error Handling:** Script skips malformed or empty inputs
- **Reproducibility:** Random seeds set for consistent results
- **Documentation:** Results and code are documented in DOCX/PDF for sharing
- **Performance:** Model inference is optimized for batch and real-time use
- **Integration:** Model can be deployed as an API or used in Jupyter notebooks
