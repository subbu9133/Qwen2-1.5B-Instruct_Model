"""# Sentiment Analysis Training with Qwen2-1.5B

This notebook trains a sentiment analysis model using:

- **Model**: Qwen2-1.5B with LoRA fine-tuning  
- **Datasets**: Amazon Reviews + Twitter Sentiment140  
- **Task**: Binary sentiment classification (positive/negative)  

**Platforms**: Google Colab, Kaggle  
**GPU**: Recommended for faster training

       ‚Ä¢ Consider deploying for production use in binary sentiment tasks
       ‚Ä¢ Monitor performance on real-world data

    2. Potential Improvements:
       ‚Ä¢ Fine-tune on domain-specific data if needed
       ‚Ä¢ Implement ensemble methods for edge cases
       ‚Ä¢ Add confidence threshold filtering for production

    3. Use Cases:
       ‚Ä¢ Social media sentiment monitoring
       ‚Ä¢ Customer feedback classification
       ‚Ä¢ Product review analysis
       ‚Ä¢ Any binary positive/negative classification task

    4. Limitations:
       ‚Ä¢ Only handles binary classification (no neutral)
       ‚Ä¢ May struggle with extremely ambiguous text
       ‚Ä¢ Requires clear positive/negative examples for training
